With the development of embedded technology and 5G communication technology, the performance limitations and network limitations that are traditionally believed to restrict the application of blockchain technology to IoT devices have been broken. The development of ""blockchain + 5G + IoT"" provides reliable data from the source for the blockchain, linking the credible mapping of physical assets and digital assets. However, at the beginning of the blockchain design, the application of the IoT was not fully considered, so there have been some obvious defects in applying the blockchain technology in the IoT. In the Byzantine fault tolerance (BFT) consensus algorithm of traditional blockchain, the entire blockchain network will become paralyzed when more than 1/3 of the nodes in the network are offline. However, in IoT applications, this situation is likely to occur and greatly limits the security and stability of the application of blockchain technology in the IoT. In order to solve this problem, we proposed an IoT adaptive dynamic blockchain networking method based on discrete heartbeat signals. The feature of the method is to set a different monitoring time for each group of nodes, that is, discrete heartbeat signals monitoring. When the number of nodes gradually decreases, the IoT adaptive dynamic blockchain network can dynamically adapt to this process. Even when more than 1/3 of the IoT are offline, the adaptive dynamic IoT blockchain network can maintain stable running. This method also has the advantages of a short network expectation recovery time and avoids instantaneous system paralysis caused by the thundering herd effect. This research improves the security and stability of the application of blockchain technology in the IoT, and provides the necessary technical foundation for the better combination of blockchain technology and IoT technology.",,Sensors,,MDPI,,2020-11-14,2020,2020-11-14,,20,22,6503,All OA; Gold,Article,"Hu, Xueyang; Zheng, Yili; Su, Yu; Guo, Rui","Hu, Xueyang (School of Technology, Beijing Forestry University, Beijing 100083, China;, huxueyang@bjfu.edu.cn); Zheng, Yili (School of Technology, Beijing Forestry University, Beijing 100083, China;, huxueyang@bjfu.edu.cn); Su, Yu (Chaintofuture Technology Limited, Beijing 100081, China;, suyu@ultrain.io, (Y.S.);, rayguo@ultrain.io, (R.G.)); Guo, Rui (Chaintofuture Technology Limited, Beijing 100081, China;, suyu@ultrain.io, (Y.S.);, rayguo@ultrain.io, (R.G.))","Zheng, Yili (Beijing Forestry University)","Hu, Xueyang (Beijing Forestry University); Zheng, Yili (Beijing Forestry University); Su, Yu (); Guo, Rui ()",Beijing Forestry University,grid.66741.32,Beijing,,China,National Natural Science Foundation of China,,China,grant.8196263,31670719,2,2,0.63,0.99,3,https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/20/22/6503/pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1132687860,46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4605 Data Management and Data Science; 4606 Distributed Computing and Systems Software,,,,,,B11 Computer Science and Informatics; B12 Engineering,

Therefore, security represents a primary concern that should be considered when engineering IoT systems. Additionally, several challenges need to be addressed, including the following ones. IoT systems' environments are dynamic and uncertain. For instance, IoT devices can be mobile or might run out of batteries, so they can become suddenly unavailable. To cope with such environments, IoT systems can be engineered as goal-driven and self-adaptive systems. A goal-driven IoT system is composed of a dynamic set of IoT devices and services that temporarily connect and cooperate to achieve a specific goal. Several approaches have been proposed to engineer goal-driven and self-adaptive IoT systems. However, none of the existing approaches enable goal-driven IoT systems to automatically detect security threats and autonomously adapt to mitigate them. Toward bridging these gaps, this paper proposes a distributed architectural Approach for engineering goal-driven IoT Systems that can autonomously SElf-adapt to secuRity Threats in their environments (ASSERT). ASSERT exploits techniques and adopts notions, such as agents, federated learning, feedback loops, and blockchain, for maintaining the systems' security and enhancing the trustworthiness of the adaptations they perform. The results of the experiments that we conducted to validate the approach's feasibility show that it performs and scales well when detecting security threats, performing autonomous security adaptations to mitigate the threats and enabling systems' constituents to learn about security threats in their environments collaboratively.",,Sensors,,MDPI,,2022-09-09,2022,2022-09-09,,22,18,6842,All OA; Gold,Article,"Alkhabbas, Fahed; Alsadi, Mohammed; Alawadi, Sadi; Awaysheh, Feras M.; Kebande, Victor R.; Moghaddam, Mahyar T.","Alkhabbas, Fahed (Internet of Things and People Research Center, Malmö University, 21119 Malmö, Sweden; Department of Computer Science and Media Technology, Malmö University, 21119 Malmö, Sweden); Alsadi, Mohammed (Department of Computer Science, Norwegian University of Science and Technology, 7491 Trondheim, Norway); Alawadi, Sadi (Department of Information Technology, Uppsala University, 75105 Uppsala, Sweden; Center for Applied Intelligent Systems Research, School of Information Technology, Halmstad University, 30118 Halmstad, Sweden); Awaysheh, Feras M.

These applications include home automation, health care, and smart agriculture. However, IoT development and adoption face various security and privacy challenges that need to be overcome. As a promising security paradigm, context-aware security enables one to enforce security and privacy mechanisms adaptively. Moreover, with the advancements in edge computing, context-aware security services can dynamically be placed close to a user's location and enable the support of low latency communication and mobility. Therefore, the design of an adaptive and decentralized access control mechanism becomes a necessity. In this paper, we propose a decentralized context-aware authorization management as a service based on the blockchain. The proposed architecture extends the Authentication and Authorization for Constrained Environments (ACE) framework with blockchain technology and context-awareness capabilities. Instead of a classic Open Authorization 2.0 (OAuth) access token, it uses a new contextual access token.

However, whether the forwarding task can be efficiently completed by the node has not attracted enough attention. A method called TrustBlock is proposed in this paper, which introduces trust as a security attribute in SDN routing planning. Besides, in order to enhance the integrity and controllability of trust evaluation, the double-layer blockchain architecture is established. In the first layer, the behavior data of the node is recorded, and then the trust calculation is performed in the second layer. In the evaluation model, nodes' trust is calculated from three aspects: direct trust, indirect trust and historical trust. Firstly, from the perspective of security, blockchain is used to achieve identity authentication of nodes, after that, from the perspective of reliability, the forwarding status is used to calculate the trust value. Secondly, consensus algorithm is used to filter malicious recommendation trust value and prevent colluding attacks. Finally, the adaptive historical trust weight is designed to prevent the periodic attack. In this paper, the entropy method is used to determine the weight of each evaluation attribute, which can avoid the problem that the subjective judgment method is not adaptable to the weight setting. Simulation results show that the detection rate of the TrustBlock is up to 98.89%, which means this model can effectively identify the abnormal nodes in SDN. Moreover, it is attractive in terms of integrity and controllability.","This research was funded by Wuhan Frontier Program of Application Foundation, grant number 2018010401011295; and National High Technology Research and Development Program of China (“863” Program), grant number 2015AA016002.",PLOS ONE,,Public Library of Science (PLoS),"Algorithms; Blockchain; Computer Communication Networks; Models, Theoretical; Remote Sensing Technology; Research Design; Software",2020-03-10,2020,2020-03-10,,15,3,e0228844,All OA; Gold,Article,"Zhao, Bo; Liu, Yifan; Li, Xiang; Li, Jiayue; Zou, Jianwen","Zhao, Bo (Key Laboratory of Aerospace Information Security and Trusted Computing, Ministry of Education, School of Cyber Science and Engineering, Wuhan University, Wuhan, China); Liu, Yifan (Key Laboratory of Aerospace Information Security and Trusted Computing, Ministry of Education, School of Cyber Science and Engineering, Wuhan University, Wuhan, China); Li, Xiang (Key Laboratory of Aerospace Information Security and Trusted Computing, Ministry of Education, School of Cyber Science and Engineering, Wuhan University, Wuhan, China); Li, Jiayue (Key Laboratory of Aerospace Information Security and Trusted Computing, Ministry of Education, School of Cyber Science and Engineering, Wuhan University, Wuhan, China); Zou, Jianwen (Key Laboratory of Aerospace Information Security and Trusted Computing, Ministry of Education, School of Cyber Science and Engineering, Wuhan University, Wuhan, China)","Liu, Yifan (Wuhan University)","Zhao, Bo (Wuhan University); Liu, Yifan (Wuhan University); Li, Xiang (Wuhan University); Li, Jiayue (Wuhan University); Zou, Jianwen (Wuhan University)",Wuhan University,grid.49470.3e,Wuhan,,China,Ministry of Science and Technology of the People's Republic of China,,China,,,12,11,0.37,6.27,1,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0228844&type=printable,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1125551157,46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4604 Cybersecurity and Privacy; 4606 Distributed Computing and Systems Software,,,,,,B11 Computer Science and Informatics,

CPS approves critical infrastructure and is treated as essential in day to day since it forms the basis of futuristic smart devices. An increased usage of CPSs poses security as a challenging issue and intrusion detection systems (IDS) can be applied for the identification of network intrusions. The latest advancements in the field of artificial intelligence (AI) and deep learning (DL) enables to design effective IDS models for the CPS environment. At the same time, metaheuristic algorithms can be employed as a feature selection approach in order to reduce the curse of dimensionality. With this motivation, this study develops a novel Poor and Rich Optimization with Deep Learning Model for Blockchain Enabled Intrusion Detection in CPS Environment, called PRO-DLBIDCPS technique. The proposed PRO-DLBIDCPS technique initially introduces an Adaptive Harmony Search Algorithm (AHSA) based feature selection technique for proper selection of feature subsets. For intrusion detection and classification, and attention based bi-directional gated recurrent neural network (ABi-GRNN) model is applied. In addition, the detection efficiency of the ABi-GRNN technique has been enhanced by the use of Poor and rich optimization (PRO) algorithm based hyperparameter optimizer, which resulted in enhanced intrusion detection results. Furthermore, blockchain technology is applied for enhancing security in the CPS environment. In order to demonstrate the enhanced outcomes of the PRO-DLBIDCPS technique, a wide range of simulations was carried out on benchmark dataset and the results reported the better outcomes of the PRO-DLBIDCPS technique in terms of several measures.",,Scientific Reports,,Springer Nature,"Algorithms; Artificial Intelligence; Blockchain; Deep Learning; Neural Networks, Computer",2022-07-28,2022,2022-07-28,2022-12,12,1,12937,All OA; Gold,Article,"Mansour, Romany F.","Mansour, Romany F.

Notably, our work is motivated by the high energy consumption for mining PoW, and we want to restrict the use of PoW to a configurable, expected size of nodes, as a function of the local blockchain state. The approach we develop for this rests on three pillars: (i) Proof of Kernel Work (PoKW), a means of dynamically reducing the set of nodes that can participate in the solving of PoW puzzles such that an adversary cannot increase his attack surface because of such a reduction; (ii) Practical Adaptation of Existing Technology, a realization of this PoW reduction through an adaptation of existing blockchain and enterprise technology stacks; and (iii) Machine Learning for Adaptive System Resiliency, the use of techniques from artificial intelligence to make our approach adaptive to system, network and attack dynamics. We develop here, in detail, the first pillar and illustrate the second pillar through a real use case, a pilot project done with Porsche on controlling permissions to vehicle and data log accesses.

This paper proposes an adaptive practical Byzantine fault tolerance algorithm in permission blockchains. This method divides the node into trust nodes and faulty nodes. The nodes with faulty reputations are excluded from voting. Also, the identified trust node has a high reputation in the consensus process. A majority of voting values select the master node.

Current protocols have fixed periods during which participants can dispute any fraud attempts. However, current blockchains have limited transaction processing capacity, so a fixed dispute period will not always be sufficient to deter all fraudulent behaviour in an off-chain protocol. In this paper we present a novel mechanism for adaptive dispute cutoffs (ADCs) which ensure that users retain the opportunity to dispute fraudulent behaviours despite blockchain congestion, while increasing second-layer protocol efficiency by reducing dispute period lengths when the number of disputes is low. We present a non-interactive argument system for setting adaptive dispute periods under the current Ethereum Virtual Machine, and describe how to efficiently integrate built-in support for adaptive dispute periods in any blockchain using binary-indexed trees.

The algorithm is suitable for consortium blockchain and private blockchain, and is written as a smart contract for Hyperledger Fabric. Unlike previously proposed blockchain’s consensus protocols, this is the first implementation that does not rely on any trusted authority to compute the tally or to protect the voter’s privacy. Instead, the algorithm is a fast adaptive protocol, and each voter is in control of the privacy of their own vote such that it can only be breached by a full collusion involving all other voters. The execution of the protocol is enforced using the consensus mechanism that also secures the Fabric blockchain. This paper tests the implementation on Fabric’s official test network to demonstrate its feasibility. Also, this paper provides a computational breakdown of its execution cost.",,Advances in Intelligent Systems and Computing,Security with Intelligent Computing and Big-data Services,Springer Nature,,2019-04-17,2019,2019-04-17,2020,895,,3-16,Closed,Chapter,"Jiang, Xin; Liu, Mingzhe; Zhao, Feixiang; Zhou, Qin; Wang, Ruili","Jiang, Xin (State Key Laboratory of Geohazard Prevention and Geoenvironment Protection, Chengdu University of Technology, Chengdu, Sichuan, China); Liu, Mingzhe (State Key Laboratory of Geohazard Prevention and Geoenvironment Protection, Chengdu University of Technology, Chengdu, Sichuan, China); Zhao, Feixiang (State Key Laboratory of Geohazard Prevention and Geoenvironment Protection, Chengdu University of Technology, Chengdu, Sichuan, China); Zhou, Qin (State Key Laboratory of Geohazard Prevention and Geoenvironment Protection, Chengdu University of Technology, Chengdu, Sichuan, China); Wang, Ruili (Institute of Natural and Mathematical Sciences, Massey University, Auckland, New Zealand)","Liu, Mingzhe (Chengdu University of Technology)","Jiang, Xin (Chengdu University of Technology); Liu, Mingzhe (Chengdu University of Technology); Zhao, Feixiang (Chengdu University of Technology); Zhou, Qin (Chengdu University of Technology); Wang, Ruili (Massey University)",Chengdu University of Technology; Massey University,grid.411288.6; grid.148374.d,Chengdu; Palmerston North,; ,China; New Zealand,,,,,,2,2,,0.85,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1113500272,46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4604 Cybersecurity and Privacy,,,,,,B11 Computer Science and Informatics,

In vehicular networks, Blockchain is a solution often considered to secure exchanges between nodes. In fact, this technology could enable each vehicle to check by itself the content of each message it receives, without the need to trust its neighbors. Nevertheless, Blockchain was initially designed for wired networks. Therefore, its deployment in vehicular networks would imply considering the features of this environment: high mobility, variable C-ITS applications’ requirements, limited vehicles capabilities, etc. That is why, in this paper, after comparing existing solutions, we introduce a new adaptive Blockchain framework, designed to address the vehicular environment challenges.

We then perform real-world experiments through our custom native blockchain and evaluate the performance impact of the approach, as well as the gains observed.

The existing spatio-temporal data query in the blockchain is realized by adding additional external storage or fixed spatio-temporal index in the block, without considering the distribution of the spatio-temporal query itself and the proof performance accompanying the query. We propose an adaptive spatio-temporal blockchain index method, called Verkle AR*-tree, which adds the verification of time and location in the blockchain without additional storage and realizes the spatio-temporal index with an encrypted signature. Verkle AR*-tree further provides an adaptive algorithm, which adjusts the tree structure according to the historical query to produce the optimized index structure. The experimental results based on the pokeman dataset show that compared with the existing static spatio-temporal index, our method can effectively increase the performance of the spatio-temporal query and the spatio-temporal commitment in the blockchain.",,ISPRS International Journal of Geo-Information,,MDPI,,2022-07-19,2022,2022-07-19,,11,7,409,All OA; Gold,Article,"Chen, Haibo; Liang, Daolei","Chen, Haibo (); Liang, Daolei ()",,"Chen, Haibo (); Liang, Daolei ()",,,,,,,,,,,0,0,,,,https://www.mdpi.com/2220-9964/11/7/409/pdf?version=1658383299,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1149617415,37 Earth Sciences; 3704 Geoinformatics; 3709 Physical Geography and Environmental Geoscience; 40 Engineering; 4013 Geomatic Engineering,,,,,,B11 Computer Science and Informatics,

Many recent blockchain protocols have focused on increasing the transaction throughput. However, existing protocols cannot dynamically scale the throughput to meet transaction demand. In this paper, we propose Occam, a secure and adaptive scaling scheme. Occam adaptively changes the transaction throughput by expanding and shrinking according to the transaction demand in the network. We introduce a dynamic adjustment mechanism of mining difficulty and a mining power load balancing mechanism to resist various attacks. Furthermore, we implement Occam on Amazon EC2 cluster with 1000 full nodes.

Eliminating middlemen and handing over controls to a trusted system of trustless agents does not thereby bestow trust across time. This is especially true when relentless change is the order of the day. Issues of governance rise up when blockchain systems (especially those that have embedded smart contracts) are forced to operate increasingly away from their original intent. Smart contracts need governance when beset with the problem of the unknown-unknowns. Guided by the axiomatic approach, this paper looks at the paradoxical issue of blockchain governance from a Complex Adaptive Systems (CAS) perspective that helps frame the fundamental problem of decentralization. The objective is to solve the Blockchain Governance Kernel Design.

Authentication, Authorization and Audit Logs (AAA) are prime features of Network Security and easily attained in legacy systems, however, remains unachieved in IoT. The IoTs require due security considerations as the conventional security mechanisms are not optimized for such devices due to various aspects such as heterogeneity, resource constrained processing, storage and multiple factors. Additionally, the legacy systems are mostly centralized and thus introduce a single point of failure. In this research, a novel framework, FBASHI is presented that is based on fuzzy logic and blockchain technology to achieve AAA services. The proposed system is developed using Hyperledger that is a blockchain platform providing privacy and fast response capability, therefore, it is best suited for the healthcare IoT environments. This work proposes behavior driven adaptive security mechanism for healthcare IoTs and networks based on blockchain by utilizing fuzzy logic and presents a heuristic approach towards behavior driven adaptive security providing AAA services.

In this framework, how to reach a consensus between the nodes while simultaneously guaranteeing the performance of both MEC and blockchain systems is a major challenge. Meanwhile, resource allocation, block size, and the number of consecutive blocks produced by each producer are critical to the performance of B-MEC. Therefore, an adaptive resource allocation and block generation scheme is proposed. To improve the throughput of the overlaid blockchain system and the quality of services (QoS) of the users in the underlaid MEC system, spectrum allocation, size of the blocks, and number of producing blocks for each producer are formulated as a joint optimization problem, where the time-varying wireless links and computation capacity of the MEC servers are considered. Since this problem is intractable using traditional methods, we resort to the deep reinforcement learning approach. Simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed approach by comparing with other baseline methods.","This work was supported in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant 61671088 and Grant 61771070, the Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications (BUPT) Excellent Ph.D. Students Foundation under Grant CX2018201, and the Canadian Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council under Grant RGPIN-2019-06348.",IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE),,2019-12-09,2019,2019-12-09,2020-03-01,19,3,1689-1703,Closed,Article,"Guo, Fengxian; Yu, F.

Each consensus mechanism has its advantages and disadvantages. Aiming at the problem that one consensus mechanism in the current blockchain cannot meet a variety of application scenarios and user needs, this paper proposes a self-adaptive consensus method. First, this paper analyzes the deficiencies of the existing consensus algorithm Raft and proposes some improvements. Then this paper combines multiple consensus algorithms to provide a self-adaptive consensus method.

To address the issue of distributed trust in these communities, blockchain technology is widely considered as a promising solution due to its ability to provide records provenance and visibility. However, the current blockchain-based platforms are known to compromise on scalability and privacy in favor of trustless interactions and often do not support interoperability. In this work, we propose a hypergraph-based adaptive consortium blockchain (HARB) framework, which coordinates DERs through high-order relationships rather than P2P pairwise relationships. HARB is presented in a three-layered network architecture to address the aforementioned challenges. The bottom layer (Underlay) addresses the issue of scalability, by exploiting the rich representation ability of hypergraphs to describe complex relationships among DERs and end users. We use the described complex relations to form scalable network clusters with intra- and inter-community energy trading relationships. The middle layer (Overlay) presents a blockchain service model to describe adaptive blockchain modules that support interoperability between the network clusters. To preserve privacy, we present a data tagging and anonymization model in the top layer (Contract), which attributes transactions to specific network clusters. To evaluate our framework, we modeled various IoT devices with different computing resource profiles to simulate a distributed energy trading (DET) environment. The analyzed results have shown that our proposed framework can effectively improve the performance of blockchain-based DET systems.",,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE),,2020-09-07,2020,2020-09-07,2022-01-15,9,16,14216-14227,All OA; Green,Article,"Karumba, Samuel; Kanhere, Salil S.; Jurdak, Raja; Sethuvenkatraman, Subbu","Karumba, Samuel (School of Computer Science and Engineering, UNSW Sydney, Sydney, NSW, 2052, Australia); Kanhere, Salil S.

The attacker in our strategy observes the length of the honest branch when a submitted transaction becomes available in the blockchain, and then updates the attack strategy accordingly. This provides a stronger strategy than conventional double-spending attack. We then derive closed-form expressions for the probability of a successful attack and the expected reward of attacker miners. Our analysis shows that the probability of a successful attack by convincing the network nodes to follow the counterfeit branch under the proposed attack strategy is 60% higher than what is expected from the conventional attack strategy when the attackers acquire 40% of the total network processing power. To counter this increase in the probability of attack, the network nodes are required to use a bigger number of confirmation blocks for validating any transaction in the blockchain. We computed the. expected reward of an attacker for mining a counterfeit branch on a blockchain and observed that the expected reward drops to zero after a few number of block confirmations.",ThiS work was. supported in part by the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council (NSERC) of Canada under Grant RGPIN 1731-2013 and by the UBC PMC-Sierra Professorship in Networking and Communications.

We examine how these three parameters are affected under an adaptive double-spend attack (ADSA). To maintain the performance of a blockchain against ADSA, the user nodes can use a larger number, $z$, of confirmation blocks for validating a transaction. A comparison of the values of $z$ needed to achieve a given target probability of successful attack is provided for ADSA and the traditional double-spend attack with different system models. The results indicate that a larger value of $z$ is required under ADSA. A more realistic reward model for attackers is also introduced.

Blockchain is a promising technology for secure data sharing and trustable cooperation between IIoT devices. However, the ever-growing transaction records make it difficult for the storage-limited IIoT devices to join the blockchain network. In this article, an adaptive compression scheme is proposed to decrease the storage volume on each node. In the scheme, the block body is compressed by representing the included transactions as their remainders stored in the distributed nodes. The original transaction could be recovered based on the Chinese remainder theorem. In particular, each node adapts its compression ratio according to its storage resource. The nodes storing more data have advantages in transaction recovery, introducing an incentive mechanism for efficient storage utilization. The theoretical analysis and simulation results show that the proposed scheme can achieve a high compression ratio with good service availability.

However, the very restricted performance and enormous energy consumption makes blockchain faltering. In this paper, we proposed a sharding blockchain framework with linear scalability. Unlike other frameworks with sharding, our model needs no centralized organization to assemble messages from subcommittees. We also redesigned the block-generating algorithm to accelerate generating block. Our framework can reach nearly linear scalability with scale of service network while tolerating no more than 1/4 adaptive byzantine adversaries. Furthermore, we designed simulation experiments with up to 1000 virtual nodes to proof our theoretical scaling properties. In our experiments, our model performs better than Bitcoin-NG when the size of network more than around 400 nodes. But delay in Bitcoin-NG grows far more than ours. Also, our framework wins out over ELASTICO while our simulation platform contains less than 1000 nodes.",This work was supported in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grants NSFC 6167050817 and 61672358.,Lecture Notes in Computer Science,Web Services – ICWS 2018,Springer Nature,,2018-06-19,2018,2018-06-19,2018,10966,,151-165,Closed,Chapter,"Cai, Shubin; Yang, Ningsheng; Ming, Zhong","Cai, Shubin (Nation Engineering Laboratory for Big Data System Computing Technology, CCSE, Shenzhen University, 518060, Shenzhen City, Guangdong Province, China); Yang, Ningsheng (Nation Engineering Laboratory for Big Data System Computing Technology, CCSE, Shenzhen University, 518060, Shenzhen City, Guangdong Province, China); Ming, Zhong (Nation Engineering Laboratory for Big Data System Computing Technology, CCSE, Shenzhen University, 518060, Shenzhen City, Guangdong Province, China)","Ming, Zhong (Shenzhen University)","Cai, Shubin (Shenzhen University); Yang, Ningsheng (Shenzhen University); Ming, Zhong (Shenzhen University)",Shenzhen University,grid.263488.3,Shenzhen,,China,National Natural Science Foundation of China,,China,grant.8306449,61672358,4,0,,1.18,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1104911031,46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4606 Distributed Computing and Systems Software,,,,,,B11 Computer Science and Informatics,

Such networks carry the promise of highly decentralized validation and witnessing of important social and economic events, reducing the need to rely on centralized authorities. Public proof-of-work based networks specifically, despite their limitations and challenges, continue to be popular due to their simplicity and intuitiveness. However, for such networks to perpetually meet viability, efficiency, security and environmental sustainability objectives, they need to adapt to environmental changes via continuous reconfiguration of their operating parameters. In this paper, we attempt to formulate this blockchain network adaptability problem as one of control engineering. We sketch the basic characteristics of blockchain networks as systems and identify variables available for designing a controller that allows such networks to attain macroscopic operating objectives.

As markets shift toward mass customization and new service delivery models, the digital representation has become more adaptive and agile by forming digital twin networks (DTN). DTN institutes a real-time single source of truth everywhere. However, there are several issues preventing DTN from further application, which are centralized processing, data falsification, privacy leakage, lack of incentive mechanism, etc. To make DTN better meet the ever-changing demands, we propose a novel blockchain-enabled adaptive asynchronous federated learning (FedTwin) paradigm for privacy-preserving and decentralized DTN. We design Proof-of-Federalism (PoF), which is a tailor-made consensus algorithm for autonomous DTN. In each DT's local training phase, generative adversarial network enhanced differential privacy is used to protect the privacy of local model parameters while a modified Isolation Forest is deployed to filter out the falsified DTs. In the global aggregation phase, an improved Markov decision process is leveraged to select optimal DTs to achieve adaptive asynchronous aggregation while providing a roll-back mechanism to redact the falsified global models.

The lack of transparent infrastructures for implementing data trust prevents many data owners from sharing their data and concerns data users regarding the quality of the shared data. Data trust is a paradigm that facilitates data sharing by forcing data users to be transparent about the process of sharing and reusing data. Blockchain technology proposes a distributed and transparent administration by employing multiple parties to maintain consensus on an immutable ledger. This paper presents an end-to-end framework for data trust to enhance trustworthy data sharing utilizing blockchain technology. The framework promotes data quality by assessing input data sets, effectively manages access control, and presents data provenance and activity monitoring. We introduce an assessment model that includes reputation, endorsement, and confidence factors to evaluate data quality. We also suggest an adaptive solution to determine the number of transaction validators based on the computed trust value. The proposed data trust framework addresses both data owners’ and data users’ concerns by ensuring the trustworthiness and quality of the data at origin and ethical and secure usage of the data at the end.

(i.e., a directed acyclic graph (DAG) with a tree embedded) that allows fast
and concurrent block generation. GHAST protocol simultaneously achieves a
logarithmically bounded liveness guarantee and low confirmation latency. More
specifically, for maximum latency $d$ and adversarial computing power bounded
away from 50\%, GHAST guarantees confirmation with confidence $\ge
1-\varepsilon$ after a time period of $O(d\cdot \log(1/\varepsilon))$. When

Although the voluntarily paid transaction fee is allowed to support BMR, the stable reward for block mining is no longer guaranteed, and which inevitably destroys the sustainability of BTS. In this work, we propose a sustainable reward mechanism (SRM)for block mining in BTS. Specifically, SRM introduces a mandatory transaction fee mechanism with dedicated fee rate determination algorithm. An on-chain public account (PA), which is trust-free but security-provable, is set to collect the dynamic transaction fees. With transaction fee collection under adaptive fee rate setting, PA provides the steady BMR, thus makes blockchain sustainable when the currency creation purposed BMR has been terminated. Numerical results are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of SRM.","This work was supported in part by NSF of China under the grant 61672467 and 61503343, and NSF of Zhejiang Province This work was supported in part by NSF of China under the grant 61672467 and 61503343, and NSF of Zhejiang Province of China under the grants LY18F030013 and LY16F030002.",,"2018 5th International Conference on Information, Cybernetics, and Computational Social Systems (ICCSS)",Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE),,2018-08-16,2018,,2018-08-16,00,,156-161,Closed,Proceeding,"Lin, Feilong; Zheng, Zhonglong; Huang, Zhiliang; Tang, Changbing; Peng, Hao; Chen, Zhongyu","Lin, Feilong (College of Mathematics, Physics and Information Engineering, Zhejiang Normal University, Zhejiang, P.

Cognitive radio networks (CRN) will provide a large bandwidth to mobile users. However, CRN networks impose challenges due to security issues and spectrum management issues. Hence, in this paper, blockchain based security enhancement and spectrum sensing method is developed for managing the spectrum as well as identify the malicious user in the CRN. In the CRN, spectrum sensing is a fundamental requirement which affected by the malicious user. The malicious user is attacking the general signal detection of network and disturbs the accuracy of the system performance. The occurrence of a malicious user in CRN sends false sensing data which decreases the presentation of the system. Blockchain-based security and spectrum sensing is achieved in the CRN network which empowers the system performance. The blockchain-based method is utilized to identify the malicious user in the CRN by an Adaptive threshold spectrum energy detection algorithm. The proposed method is implemented in MATLAB and performance is evaluated by performance metrics such as the probability of detection, false alarm probability, sensing performance gain, total error probability, missed detection probability, number of selected sensing nodes, average network throughput, and energy efficiency. The proposed method is compared by existing methods such as Friend or Foe and Tidal Trust Algorithm.",This work is supported by FCT/MCTES through national funds and when applicable co-funded EU funds under the Project UIDB/EEA/50008/2020; and by Brazilian National Council for Research and Development (CNPq) via Grant No. 313036/2020-9.,Wireless Personal Communications,,Springer Nature,,2021-07-06,2021,2021-07-06,,,,1-23,Closed,Article,"Khanna, Ashish; Rani, Poonam; Sheikh, Tariq Hussain; Gupta, Deepak; Kansal, Vineet; Rodrigues, Joel J.

Using CR, the trans receiver is able to send scan signals on the network to evaluate if the network is free or not. Once the scan is complete, then data communication is performed on the network. In order to optimize the network performance, various state-of-the-art approaches are proposed which optimize the quality of service (QoS) parameters like end-to-end communication delay, throughput, energy consumption, packet delivery ratio, etc. While optimizing these QoS parameters, there are certain security loop holes created in the CRNs. Due to these loop holes, the sensing capabilities of the CR nodes get affected as attackers induce invalid signatures on the nodes, thereby making them misbehave. In order to reduce these attacks, this paper introduces a blockchain based approach to secure the cognitive radio network. But due to the inclusion of a security framework, the network QoS reduces. In order to reduce the effect of blockchain on QoS, an adaptive Artificial Intelligence (AI) is incorporated into the network. This AI layer is responsible for enhancing the QoS performance, while keeping the CRN secure. The AI layer uses sidechains in order to perform this task. This work is observed to have a 20% higher trust level than non-blockchain based security algorithms, while maintaining a 10% improvement in the overall network QoS.",,Lecture Notes in Electrical Engineering,ICCCE 2021,Springer Nature,,2022-05-16,2022,2022-05-16,2022,828,,629-638,Closed,Chapter,"Chopade, Shital S.; Dalu, Surendra S.","Chopade, Shital S.

As a result, an operating UAV network is essentially a Byzantine distributed system whose physical structure and node trustworthiness change over time. How to implement the global management of UAV networks to achieve a rational allocation of UAV network resources and reconfiguration of trusted networks is a problem worthy of in-depth study. The method proposed in this paper introduces a lightweight storage blockchain in the UAV network through two-stage consensus, firstly performing data consensus on the local state records of the nodes, then performing decision consensus on the data consensus results using algorithms such as fuzzy K-Modes clustering and global trustworthiness assessment, and finally recording the decision consensus results into a new block as the new configuration information of the UAV network. A lightweight storage blockchain-assisted trusted zone routing protocol (BC_TZRP) is designed to dynamically and adaptively build configurable trusted networks in a way that the blockchain continuously adds new blocks. Using QualNet simulation experimental software, an experimental comparison between the classical routing protocol for mobile self-organizing networks and the traditional consensus algorithm for blockchains is conducted. The results show that the approach has significant advantages in terms of packet delivery rate, routing overhead and average end-to-end delay, and can effectively improve the overall working life and fault tolerance of the UAV network.",,Electronics,,MDPI,,2022-08-15,2022,2022-08-15,,11,16,2549,All OA; Gold,Article,"Kong, Lingjun; Chen, Bing; Hu, Feng","Kong, Lingjun (); Chen, Bing (); Hu, Feng ()",,"Kong, Lingjun (); Chen, Bing (); Hu, Feng ()",,,,,,National Natural Science Foundation of China; Ministry of Science and Technology of the People's Republic of China,,China; China,,,0,0,,,,https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9292/11/16/2549/pdf?version=1660566770,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1150258677,"40 Engineering; 4009 Electronics, Sensors and Digital Hardware",,,,,,B11 Computer Science and Informatics,

In cryptocurrencies, this abstraction is usually implemented by grouping transactions in blocks that are then linked together to form a blockchain. Nodes need to exchange information to maintain the status of the chain but this process consumes significant network resources. Unfortunately, naively reducing the number of messages exchanged can have a negative impact in performance and correctness, as some transactions might not be included in the chain. In this paper, we study the mechanisms of information dissemination used in Bitcoin and propose a set of adaptive mechanisms that lower network resource usage.

Theses permissionless consensuses are called BFT consensus and are based on communication between participants of the network. By design, latency and throughput of transaction commitment are impacted by the number of participants because an agreement with more participants takes more time. On the contrary, a chain shared with more participants is more secure to a same number of malicious users. Theses two properties implies that the number of validator is a trade off between security and performances that can potentially evolve according to demands. The present research proposes Sabine (Self-Adaptive BlockchaIn coNsEnsus protocol) a new consensus based on PBFT to optimally and dynamically adapt the pool of validator in order that the output transaction throughput meets the input transaction throughput, with a minimum limit on the number of validators, implying a more reactive chain, with less latency.

  The focal point of this architecture is a dynamic self-allocation algorithm

action, without requiring a central or cryptographic proof. This architecture
has several attractive features unusual for sharding protocols, including: (a)
the ability to handle the regime of large number of shards (relative to the

Direct Acyclic Graph (DAG) ledger(s) is a new form of DLT technology designed for Internet-of- Things (IoT) devices due to the nature of its disadvantages of the computing powers and limited network bandwidth. IOTA is a DAG-based Blockchain implementation for IoT applications that has gained an increased attention in recent years. One of the major concerns that is hindering for its wide adaptation is the security concerns. Many security attack occurrences against the IOTA such as parasite attacks, double spending, and DDoS to disrupt availability resources of the new ledger can become both widespread and disruptive. Existing security studies are ad-hoc and typically address a solution scheme for a specific security threat. In this paper, we present an adaptive Reinforcement-Learning (RL) approach to best classify the monitored resource consumption parameters of the DAG-based nodes or devices for any potential security anomaly detection.

is getting practical and necessary. In geographically distributed systems, the
pace at which consensus is achieved is limited by the heterogenous latencies of
connections between replicas. If deployed on a wide-area network,
consensus-based systems benefit from weighted replication, an approach that
utilizes extra replicas and assigns higher voting power to well connected
replicas. This enables more choice in quorum formation and replicas can
leverage proportionally smaller quorums to advance, thus decreasing consensus
latency. However, the system needs a solution to autonomously adjust to its
environment if network conditions change or faults occur. We present Adaptive
Wide-Area REplication (AWARE), a mechanism which improves the geographical
scalability of consensus with nodes being widely spread across the world.
Essentially, AWARE is an automated and dynamic voting weight tuning and leader
positioning scheme, which supports the emergence of fast quorums in the system.
It employs a reliable self-monitoring process and provides a prediction model
seeking to minimize the system's consensus latency. In experiments using
several AWS EC2 regions, AWARE dynamically optimizes consensus latency by
self-reliantly finding a fast weight configuration yielding latency gains
observed by clients located across the globe.",,arXiv,,,,2020-11-03,2020,,,,,,All OA; Green,Preprint,"Berger, Christian; Reiser, Hans P.; Sousa, João; Bessani, Alysson","Berger, Christian (); Reiser, Hans P.
